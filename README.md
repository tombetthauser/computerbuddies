# Computer Buddies

Some things I made for my kid sort of. Hand sculpted at 1:6 scale in oil clay then cast in natural wax, resin, concrete and other stuff. Available by email or in-person request.

## If you want one...

Available in person or by email with the subject "computer buddy". Limited availability. Buying one also gets you a hand-drawn post-it note portrait to be included in a free-to-download zine series and 2023 exhibition.

All proceeds go to covering materials costs and convention fees. Any extra money will be donated to local hacker spaces in Sacramento, CA.
